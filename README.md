## API Documentation
We used Swagger to document our API which is only running on localhost. Here are a few screenshots from the Swagger Page:

Endpoints that dont require authentication can also be tried directly!

## UI
We created UI scetches with figma, so we exactly knew where everything should be later (when writing the code)
